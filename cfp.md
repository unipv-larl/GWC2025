### 13th International Global Wordnet Conference
#### Pavia, Italy
#### January 27-31, 2025

 
The Global Wordnet Association is delighted to announce the 13th International Global Wordnet Conference (GWC2025), to be held in Pavia (Italy) from 27 to 31 January, 2025. The GWC2025 conference will be hosted by the Department of Humanities, at the University of Pavia, under the auspices of the Italian Association of Computational Linguistics (AILC), Almo Collegio Borromeo, Collegio Ghislieri, and NTT Data.
 
We invite submissions of original research contributions addressing, though not limited to, the topics listed below. **Presentations of new WordNets** will be assigned to a dedicated panel. Additionally, proposals for tutorials and demonstrations or panel discussions on **Wordnet for ancient languages** are encouraged.

## Conference Topics
### 1. Lexical semantics and meaning representation
- Critical analysis and applications of lexical and semantic relations
- Proposed new relations
- Definitions, semantic components, co-occurrence and frequency statistics
- Word, sense, and context embeddings
- Necessity and completeness issues
- Ontology and wordnet
- Lexical semantics of emotions and other lexical fields of interest for lexical typology (e.g. body parts, colors, motion verbs, etc.)
- Wordnets and other modalities
- Wordnets and other theoretical frameworks for modelling lexical semantics
- Other lexicographical and lexicological questions pertaining to wordnet-style meaning representation
### 2. Architecture of lexical databases
- Language independent and language dependent components
- Integration of multi-wordnets in research infrastructures (e.g., CLARIN, ELG, ELRA, etc.) 
- Wordnets and Linked Open Data (LOD)
### 3. Tools and methods for wordnet development
- User and data entry interfaces
- Methods for constructing, extending, and enriching wordnets
- Methods for linking wordnets to other lexical and semantic resources
- Methods for leveraging existing wordnets and semantic networks with large language models
- Wordnets for under-resourced languages
### 4. Applications of wordnet
- Word sense disambiguation
- Text generation
- Commonsense reasoning
- Machine translation
- Information extraction and retrieval
- Document structuring and categorization
- Text classification
- Automatic hyperlinking
- Language teaching
- Psycholinguistic applications
- Embeddings and pretrained language models
- Probing large language models
### 5. Standardization, distribution and availability of wordnets and wordnet tools
- Best practices for wordnet maintenance, standardization, and distribution
- Evaluation metrics for wordnet tools and resources
- Interoperability across wordnets and wordnet tools
- Licensing and legal considerations for wordnets distribution
- APIs and other web services for accessing wordnets
- Strategies for community involvement in wordnet standardization

## 
Submissions should fall into one of the following categories (page limits exclude references):
- **Long papers**: 8 pages max, 30 minute presentation
- **Short papers**: 5 pages max, 15 minute presentation
- **Project reports**: 5 pages max, 10 minute presentation
- **Demonstrations**: 5 pages max, with up to 3 additional pages for screenshots or images, 20 minute presentation

Submissions must be **anonymized**, and any identifying information must be removed. Authors should indicate their preferred submission category; however, the final category of acceptance may be adjusted by the organising and scientific committees (e.g., if need be, a long paper submission may be accepted as a short paper).

To enhance replicability and transparency, authors are encouraged to **share the data and code** used in their research, whenever possible in an anonymized form. We recommend exploring data repositories that support anonymization techniques and open-source code hosting platforms like [GitHub](https://anonymous.4open.science/).

**Camera-ready and final papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format only.**

Paper submissions must adhere to the **official ACL style templates** available [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) for LaTeX and Word. Please also follow the general paper formatting guidelines established by the ‚Äú*ACL‚Äù conferences available [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html). Authors should not modify these style-sheet files or use templates designed for other conferences.
 
Papers must be submitted via the **EasyChair website**: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gwc2025
