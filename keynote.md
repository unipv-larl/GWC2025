### Title and abstract
#### Towards a Cultural WordNet: From Words to Meanings to Cross-Cultural Nuances
Language is more than just words—it is also a reflection of the individuals, cultures, and societies that shape it. While computational linguistics has traditionally focused on words and their relations, the emerging field of computational sociolinguistics has demonstrated that we can effectively leverage the interplay between language and people. In this talk, I will explore the idea of a Cultural WordNet—-a resource that captures the diversity of behaviors, beliefs, and linguistic expressions across different cultural groups. I will discuss our progress toward that, including: (1) developing cross-cultural language models that identify words used significantly differently across cultures, along with their cultural nuances; and (2) creating cultural language-vision representations that map concepts to culturally-specific visual representations.

## Marco Passarotti - Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan
Marco Passarotti is Full Professor of Computational Linguistics at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Milan, Italy), where he is Director of the CIRCSE Research Centre and Coordinator of the MA in Linguistic Computing. 

His main research interests deal with building, using and disseminating linguistic resources and natural language processing tools for Latin. 

A former pupil of one of the pioneers of humanities computing, father Roberto Busa SJ, since 2006 he has headed the Index Thomisticus Treebank project. Between 2018 and 2023, he was the principal investigator of the LiLa project, an ERC-Consolidator Grant that built a Linked Data Knowledge Base of interoperable linguistic resources for Latin. He authored around 200 publications.

### Title and abstract
#### WordNet in the Net. Making It All Interact
The talk will discuss the topic of interoperability of a WordNet with other (both lexical and textual) resources on the Web. Particularly, the talk will detail the publication as Linked Open Data (LOD) of a manually checked version of the Latin WordNet. First, the LiLa Knowledge Base of interoperable resources for Latin will be introduced, as the ecosystem where the LOD version of the Latin WordNet is published (https://lila-erc.eu). Then, the process of modeling the (meta)data of the WordNet will be described, introducing the Ontolex-lemon model for lexical resources. Finally, the talk will present some practical uses of a few online services offered by LiLa to query the resources interlinked therein, particularly focussing on data from the Latin WordNet. To conclude, the issue about the future of WordNet in the era of Large Language Models will be tackled.

## Piek Vossen - Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
Prof. Dr. P.Th.J.M. (Piek) Vossen is full Professor of Computational Lexicology at the VU University Amsterdam, Head of the Computational Lexicology &amp; Terminology Lab (CLTL) and co-founder of the Global WordNet Assocation in 2000 ( GWA ). 

In 2013 he won the prestigious Spinoza Award of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and in 2015 he has been honoured by the Dutch Royal House as a
“Knight in the Order of the Dutch Lion”. He is also a member the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen (KNAW) and the Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen ( KHMW ).

Piek Vossen studied Dutch and General Linguistics at the University of Amsterdam and received his PhD (cum laude) in Linguistics on Computational Lexicology and Lexicography. 

He is/has been involved in many national and international projects, among which: Acquilex, EuroWordNet, Meaning, Cornetto, DutchSemCor, KYOTO and Global WordNet Grid. In one of his latest projects NewsReader he developed the ‘History Recorder’, a computer program that ‘reads’ the news each day and precisely records what happened when and where in the world and who was involved. 
Furthermore he developed 4 research projects with his Spinoza-price: “Understanding of Language by Machines – an escape from the world of language”, plus 2 follow up research projects on  Make Robots Talk &amp; Think (Leolani) .
He is one of the principal investigators of the Gravity project Hybrid Intelligence, funded by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and co-applicant of the Globalise -project to disclose the UNESCO archive with more than 25 million pages of historical records by the VOC. He also is co-applicant of A-Proof, where the aim is to evaluate effectiveness and costs of allied healthcare in patients recovering from COVID-19 and projectcoordinator of the robot-project Communicating with and Relating to Social Robots: Alice Meets Leolani’ –  ALANI.

His research interests are WordNets, Computational Lexicon, Ontologies, Computational Linguistics, Language Technology and Computer-Applications, both within a single language and from a multilingual perspective. Vossen is interested in
the relation between lexicons and ontologies, from a theoretical point of view as well as from their usage in computer-applications in which meaning and interpretation play a role. He sees the lexicon as a fundamental resource to anchor meaning and
interpretation in useful computer behaviour. Computer behaviour can make use of communicative models and insights from communication science. The organization of the lexicon and the knowledge stored in it need to take that usage as a starting point. He combines linguistics and computer science to model understanding of
natural language texts by computers.
